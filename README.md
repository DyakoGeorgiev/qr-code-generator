# qr-code-generator

Given existing directory (source directory) and depth of search, the program generates QR code for
every file.
The program stores the information inside another directory (target directory), preserving the
directory hierarchy, but randomly changing the name of the file (resulted QR
Code). The mapping between, the original file and the respective QR Code is stored in every directory in a hidden file called, qr_codes.


The program now works only with .txt files.
